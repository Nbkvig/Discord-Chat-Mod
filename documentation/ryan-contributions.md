### What I did: 
* Created a basic webpage to use as a dashboard for the bot, using React, Node.js, and tailwindcss, and all underlying dependencies. 

### What's next:
* Need a data base to connect this front end to. This front end is useless without a proper backend.  

### **What broke or Got Weird**
* Using example data for now. Tailwindcss4 is not compatible with OSX, so I am using Tailwindcss3 for now. Hopefully this doesn't break anything later on...

### What I did: 
* Configured main.py to talk to discord. Basic I/O to test if users could interact with the bot. 

### What's next:
* Time to add functions! The bot works just fine, now its time to brainstorm and see what we want to add to it. 

### **What broke or Got Weird**
* Since everything is in such a barebonens state, there's nothing that needs to be fixed yet.
