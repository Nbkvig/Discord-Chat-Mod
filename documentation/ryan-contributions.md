### What I did: 
* Configured main.py to talk to discord. Basic I/O to test if users could interact with the bot. 

### What's next:
* Time to add functions! The bot works just fine, now its time to brainstorm and see what we want to add to it. 

### **What broke or Got Weird**
* Since everything is in such a barebonens state, there's nothing that needs to be fixed yet.
